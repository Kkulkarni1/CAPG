- ART indel model is totally bogus (put in stat580 folder of bad coding examples)
- ART can use different quality scores for different (true?) bases
- ART inserts indels then copies reference sequence into read
- ART generates quality scores from distributions available in files in Illumina_profiles directory of distribution.
- ART assumes quality scores are correct and generates errors at random.

- The current bug in mlogit on branch ksd is that initialize_model_parameters() is never called, and therein ejqhb and other important parameters are initialized.  This is a pulling bootstraps problem!

- Artyomenk2017 (2SNV) is designed to "haplotype" PacBio reads of RNA viruses.  It does hierarchical partitioning of the reads by testing for unusual linkage of two alleles.  The idea is very simple, but Ruolin said this software "benchmarked" best on his data.  One can think of 2SNV as a simplified version of DADA2 that does not actually model errors or anything really.
